## What is PDFRecon?

PDFRecon is a **forensic analysis tool** designed to detect signs of alteration in PDF documents. It scans PDF files for over **40 technical indicators** that reveal editing, manipulation, or hidden content—essential for:

- 🏛️ **Legal proceedings** - Verify authenticity of contracts and evidence
- 💰 **Financial audits** - Detect altered invoices and statements  
- 🎓 **Academic integrity** - Check for modified transcripts and certificates
- 🔍 **Digital forensics** - Comprehensive PDF analysis for investigations
- 🛡️ **Fraud detection** - Identify manipulated documentation

---

## Features

### 🔍 Deep PDF Analysis
PDFRecon examines the internal structure of PDF files to detect forensic indicators that are invisible to normal PDF viewers.

### 📜 Revision Extraction
When a PDF is edited with "Save" instead of "Save As", the previous version remains hidden inside the file. PDFRecon automatically extracts ALL previous versions.

<p align="center">
  <i>Example: A document saved 5 times contains 5 complete versions—PDFRecon extracts them all</i>
</p>

### 📊 Timeline Generation
Creates a chronological view of all timestamps found in metadata, showing when the document was:
- Created
- Modified
- Printed
- Signed
- Accessed

### 🔐 Digital Signature Analysis
- Detects signed documents
- Verifies signature validity
- Identifies modifications made AFTER signing

### 📋 Comprehensive Reports
Export findings to:
- **Excel (.xlsx)** - Full analysis with all indicators
- **CSV** - For data processing
- **JSON** - For programmatic access
- **HTML** - For web viewing

### 💼 Case Management
- Save analysis sessions as `.prc` case files
- Reload cases to continue investigation
- Add notes to individual files
- Verify file integrity with MD5 hashes

### 📦 Reader Export
Create self-contained analysis packages that can be shared with colleagues who don't have PDFRecon installed.

| **XMP History** | Editing history recorded in metadata |
| **Document ID Mismatch** | IDs don't match (document merged or heavily edited) |
| **Multiple startxref** | Multiple cross-reference tables (incremental saves) |
| **Objects Gen > 0** | Objects were deleted and their numbers reused |
| **White Rectangle Overlay** | White shapes drawn to hide content |
| **Invisible Text** | Text with rendering mode 3 (not displayed) |
| **Date Mismatch** | Creation/modification dates don't match between Info and XMP |
| **Linearized + Updated** | Web-optimized PDF was later modified |
| **Has Redactions** | Document contains redaction annotations |

## Manual Verification

PDFRecon includes a comprehensive **forensic manual** (Help → Manual) that explains:

### For Each Indicator:
- ✅ What it means forensically
- ✅ Step-by-step hex editor instructions
- ✅ Exact byte patterns to search for
- ✅ How to decode the data
- ✅ Command-line verification methods

### Example: Finding TouchUp_TextEdit Manually

```
1. Open PDF in hex editor (HxD, 010 Editor)
2. Search for: TouchUp_TextEdit
3. Or search hex: 2F 54 6F 75 63 68 55 70
4. Look for /PieceInfo dictionary containing:
   /LastModified (D:20240115143000+01'00')
   /Private << /TouchUp_TextEdit true >>
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Decompress PDF for analysis
qpdf --qdf --object-streams=disable input.pdf output.pdf

# Count revisions (%%EOF markers)
grep -c "%%EOF" file.pdf

# Extract all metadata
exiftool -a -G file.pdf

# Check digital signatures
pdfsig file.pdf
```

PDFRecon is a forensic **analysis** tool. The presence of indicators does **not** constitute proof of malicious intent—many indicators can result from legitimate editing operations (form filling, digital signing, normal saves).

**Always combine automated analysis with:**
- Manual verification
- Expert judgment
- Context about document origin
