The "Artistic License"

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
    created through textual modification.

    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified in such a way as to preserve the

    standard distribution point, and such that the Copyright Holder's
    name, notice, and version number are not changed.

    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
    copyrights for the package.

    "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
    this Package.

    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
    and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large.)

    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
    the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
    separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute an equivalent copy of the Standard Version of the
    source code along with the executable, on the same media which you
    use for the executable, possibly under separate directories, or
    under a different directory name than the standard one. The source
    code for executables must be provided and cannot be past the
    point of compilation. The source code must be available to anyone
    who receives the executable.

    b) accompany the executable with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give a third party, for a fee no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the source code for the executable, to be
    distributed under the same terms as specified in this document.

    c) distribute the executable by offering access to copy the
    source code from a designated place (for example, via FTP or
    World Wide Web), and inform recipients of the executable how
    to obtain it.

The source code for executables must be provided and cannot be past the
point of compilation. The source code must be available to anyone who
receives the executable.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may command a fee for support of this Package.  You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself.  However, you may distribute this
Package in conjunction with other public domain or Freely Available
packages as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them,
and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
